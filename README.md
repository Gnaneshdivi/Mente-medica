# Mente Medica
Welcome to the awesome repository of the project Mente Medica by team Bit_Bots.

Before you start running your mind to guess what does the project name even mean (which is a great mental expercise BTW), we would like to share little statictics related to Mental Health with you -

![Statistics](https://github.com/lakshmisaibhargavi/mente_medica/blob/master/Pics/stats.png)

Of course their is more to this data than this part of the table shows, but the question is, would you care to read it?

# Why you should care?

Because even if you are in a happy state of mind, you should care because your loved ones can have to deal with mental disorders. You should care because you live in a society and human beings are a social animal thriving due to each other's support. Gun violence, terrorism and Suicides can all be traced back to some sort of mental sickness. 

And then you want to live in a happier world, don't you?
